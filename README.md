# ETS2MP-Companion
This will be a companion app for [ETS2MP](https://ets2mp.com/) players, compatible with Android devices.

It is still very early in the development, so there's not much to see here just yet. However, you are more than welcome to join the effort – if you so will. In that case message me at [uruba@outlook.com](mailto:uruba@outlook.com) and we can talk further. Or not. Pull requests are welcome either way.

*If you have any suggestion or want to report an issue, you can post in [the application's thread on the ETS2MP discussion board](http://forum.ets2mp.com/index.php?/topic/22715-unofficial-ets2mp-companion-android-application-concept/) or you can use the issue tracker here on GitHub.*

**At this stage of development, everything is up for a discussion – especially the feature set that the app is to contain. Every comment, suggestion or critique is therefore very welcome.**
