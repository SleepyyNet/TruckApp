# ETS2MP-Companion
This will be a companion app for [ETS2MP](https://ets2mp.com/) players, compatible with Android devices.

It is still very early in the development, so there's not much to see here just yet. However, you are more than welcome to join the effort – if you so will. In that case message me at [uruba@outlook.com](mailto:uruba@outlook.com) and we can talk further.

**At this stage of development, everything is up for a discussion – especially the feature set that the app is to contain. Every comment, suggestion or critique is therefore very welcome.**
